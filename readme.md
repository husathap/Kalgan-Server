# Kalgan Server

Kalgan Server is a server that is used to conduct a study for Kalgan, a video player featured at CHI'18. It contains the video player, a remote online tracker, and a rudimentary interview booking system.

## Before Using

For obvious reasons, credentials and URLs have been removed from Kalgan Server. So before running the server, you will need to supply these yourself. You will need a subscription to Microsoft Translation API as well.

Although Kalgan is a video player, it is embedded in Kalgan Server. You will need to remove the server code if you want to use this as a personal video player. The Late-Breaking Work paper presented at CHI'18 describes how you can use Kalgan: https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657786
